# MY X NES
My X Nes is a portable open source NES/FAMICOM emulator written in C# using XNA Framework for windows and Xbox 360 platforms.
My X Nes is a port of "my Nes" emulator, see <https://github.com/jegqamas/My-Nes>

Please note that this is an out-dated project, and it is no more under development.
I added this repository just in hope to be useful for developers whom want to take a look on an example for XNA.
Please note that this is the official repository of the program.
